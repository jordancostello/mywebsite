                <h1>Front End Development</h1>
                <p>Front end developers are needed to make interactive websites, like this one. The
                    people
                    need a place to buy wigs! Just take it from Jeff here.</p>
                <blockquote>"I was minding my own business when a robot attacked me. If there was a website to buy wigs
                    that
                    I liked, I would've bought a wig and this wouldn't have happened. OMGZ"</blockquote>
                <cite>Jeff</cite>
                <p>And it was at that moment that Jeff knew... that he'd made an honest mistake in
                    saying
                    front end development is pointless and someone could just make an editor like publisher and have it
                    generate the code automatically.
